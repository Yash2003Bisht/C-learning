1) taking line as a input in one line
You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where s is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where
MAX_LEN is the maximum size of s. Here, [] is the scanset character. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered.
Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.

Note: The statement: scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); will not work because the last statement will read a newline
character, \n, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways. One way is to use scanf("\n");
before the last statement.

2) gcc compiler

--------- To compile a C program
gcc file_name.c -> gcc test.c

--------- To run compiled files
./file_name.exe -> for windows
./file_name.out -> for linux

--------- To give a name of compiled file
gcc file_name.c -o file_name_you_want_to_give -> gcc test.c -o hello.exe

--------- To check the size of executable file in bytes
gcc file_name.c ; size executable_file_name.exe -> for windows
gcc file_name.c ; size executable_file_name.out -> for linux

--------- Another Way ---------
gcc file_name.c -> compile the file first
// than check size
size executable_file_name.exe -> for windows
size executable_file_name.out -> for linux
