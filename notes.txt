1) taking line as a input in one line

You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where s is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where MAX_LEN is the maximum size of s. Here, [] is the scanset character. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.

Note: The statement: scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); will not work because the last statement will read a newline character, \n, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways. One way is to use scanf("\n"); before the last statement.
