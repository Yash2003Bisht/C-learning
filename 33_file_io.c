        -------------------- WHY DO WE NEED A FILE? --------------------
        - Files are used to store data and information.
        - Files are used to read & access data anytime from the hard disk.
        - Files make it easy for a programmer to access and store content without losing it on program termination.
        - When a program is terminated, the data stored in RAM(Random Access Memory) is lost.
        - Storing data in a file will preserve our data even after the program terminates.
        - RAM is not able to handle quite large amount of data due to small size relative to the hard disk.
        - It is easy to transfer data as files.

        -------------------- VOLATILE VS NON-VOLATILE MEMORY --------------------
        Volatile Memory                                         |  Non-Volatile memory 
        - Volatile memory is a computer storage that only       |  - Non-volatile memory is a computer memory that can
          maintains its data while the device is powered.       |    retain the stored information even when not
                                                                |    powered.
        - The RAM will holds data, programs, and information    |  - This type of memory is also referred to as
          as long as it has a computer power supply but         |    permanent memory since data stored withint it can
          immediately the power is interrupted all that         |    be retrieved even when there is no constant power 
          content is cleared.                                   |    supply.
        - The Volatile memory will only hold data temporarily.  |  - It is used for long-term storage data.

        -------------------- TYPES OF FILES --------------------
        - There are two most common types of files for data storage:
            - Text files
            - Binary files

        -------------------- FILE OPRATIONS IN C --------------------
        - In C we can perform these high level operations on files:
            1. Creating a new file
            2. Opening a file.
            3. Closing a file.
            4. Reading from and Writing to a file.
